Description: Idea to provide simple interface for calculating RAPELD parcel areas for ppbio.
  Not pretty but it works.
  Takes compass bearings and distances recorded during plot installation
  and then: 
  1) derives coordinates and calculates the survey area of nonlinear plots.
  2) exports .pdf files showing plots
  3) exports calculated areas as .csv
  4) Exports plot lines as shapefiles and .kml
