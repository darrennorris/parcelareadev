Description: Idea to provide simple interface for calculating parcel areas for ppbio.
  Not pretty but it works.
  Takes compass bearings and distances recorded during plot installation
and then: 
1) derives coordinates and calculates the survey area of nonlinear plots.
2) exports .pdf files showing plots
3) exports calculated areas as .csv
4) Exports plot lines as shapefiles and .kml
